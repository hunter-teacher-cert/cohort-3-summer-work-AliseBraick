#### How It Works
##### Warm Up Routine + Daily Insytructional Pedagogy
* Student wil be given plugged or unplugged activity about a concept they already learned from previous lessons.
* The solution of this activity is not working as intended.
* Student task is to find the error and explain the misconception.
* The same warm up routing will be used during the share out time of the daily lesson . Teacher will pick up the best wrong solution and spark a class discussion  discussion about the misconception
  
#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* Mistakes are == Okay. We try, test, and reflect. We won’t always have initial success. Oftentimes, there is more than one approach to a solution. The key is for the students to keep trying. Create a low-risk environment.
* Confidence == GrowthMindSet == Success. Student will strat viewing mistakes as valuable—not as something negative or something to be embarrassed by. Rather, it is an opportunity to learn and experience success after failure.


#### Rollout Timeline
* Daily routine

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Teacher /colleauges observation of student attitue toward failure.
* Student perception survey pre/post to gauge student attitude toward problem solving and challenges.

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Some students might still be intimidated by making mistakes not embrassing the growt mind set.
* Invite a student volunteer to help those students during lunch.
* Offering an extra credit incentive for the student volunteer and for those who received the help once they complete the assignmnet.
